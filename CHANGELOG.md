## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`cfa4b82`](https://github.com/clamp-sh/clamp/commit/cfa4b8275f95bda53de7ad6c00180bbad91934e7) Thanks [@sbj-o](https://github.com/sbj-o)! - Added `referrer_host` filter to `get_overview`, `get_top_pages`, `get_events`, `get_timeseries`, and `get_funnel`. Use it to scope analytics to visitors from a specific source (e.g. `referrer_host="news.ycombinator.com"` to see which pages Hacker News visitors read).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [`8ca258d`](https://github.com/clamp-sh/clamp/commit/8ca258d4cfcdca8cfd5127a16225d23214145656) Thanks [@sbj-o](https://github.com/sbj-o)! - Defer API key validation and bootstrap to first tool call so the server starts and responds to introspection without a valid key.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`bbe51b5`](https://github.com/clamp-sh/clamp/commit/bbe51b561f882bf8464ef1c231561761684bdb08) Thanks [@sbj-o](https://github.com/sbj-o)! - Auto-detect project from API key at startup. The MCP server now calls a bootstrap endpoint to resolve the project, removing the need to pass project_id on every tool call and prompt.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`5fae53b`](https://github.com/clamp-sh/clamp/commit/5fae53bf27792cef8d971c2600907cbf9a14f8c2) Thanks [@sbj-o](https://github.com/sbj-o)! - Added `get_cities` tool for visitor breakdown by city with optional country filter.
